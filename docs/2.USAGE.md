# Usage

### Front-end

1. On October Backend, goto CMS page.
2. Click on the `Components` button on the left sidebar.
3. Drag selected component to your page.
4. Configure component parameters (like form validation, notification settings, etc)
5. To create your custom form, you need to override the component HTML | ([more info](https://octobercms.com/docs/cms/components#overriding-partials))
   * if your component alias is `genericForm`, create a new partial and set as filename `genericForm/default.htm`
   * write your own HTML form
   * if you need an example, you can take a look the file `components/genericform/default.htm`

Your form is ready to use.
